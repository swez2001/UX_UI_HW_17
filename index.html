                <p> I graduated from Monash University at the end of 2022 achieving a Degree in Bachelor of Information Technology. When doing my bachelorâ€™s I realised that I had more strength in creativity than programming, as I was able to produce better quality work within the IT Design. 
                    This included Usability, Product Design & Web Design. I have also liked the Analytics part of IT which involves designing & building dashboards to showcase Data. 
                    I wanted to further increase my knowledge in UI/UX so I decided to take part in a bootcamp which gave training in all aspects of UI/UX Design process, in both group and individual environments. 
                    This includes the ability to empathise, define & solve problems, prototype & end-to-end testing.
